**Best practies used in terraform code and  github actions**

**Remote State Management**

  Use an S3 bucket to store Terraform state files.
  Ensures shared and secure state management across environments.
  

**Use Modules for Reusability**

Organize infrastructure into reusable modules such as VPC, EKS, RDS, IAM, and SG.
Promotes cleaner, modular, and maintainable code.

**Workspaces for Environments**

Manage multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) using Terraform workspaces.
Keeps configurations consistent and isolated between environments.

**Variables and Locals**

Define environment-specific values in variables.tf.
Simplifies parameter management.

**Secrets Management**

Do not hardcode credentials in Terraform code.
Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to fetch sensitive data such as DB credentials.
